Here’s a detailed breakdown addressing your questions and structuring the implementation process:

---

### 1. **Non-Spike Data Ratio**
   - **Ideal Ratio**: Start with a 1:10 (spike:non-spike) ratio. This reflects the rarity of spikes in real-world scenarios and trains the model to avoid over-predicting.
   - **Reasoning**: A higher ratio emphasizes the rarity of spikes while ensuring the model doesn’t become biased against them. If you notice under-prediction, you can slightly reduce the ratio (e.g., 1:5).
   - **Implementation**:
     - Augment non-spike data by selecting random non-spike windows that don’t overlap with spikes.
     - Monitor metrics like precision and recall to ensure the ratio isn't causing excessive under-predictions.

### 2. **Incremental vs. All-at-Once Implementation**
   - **Incremental Approach**: Implementing changes one at a time is better for:
     - Debugging: Easier to isolate and address issues.
     - Learning: Helps you understand the impact of each change.
     - Iterative Improvement: Builds a solid foundation before adding complexity.
   - **Recommendation**: Incremental implementation is best for long-term success.

### 3. **Prioritized Implementation List**
**Ordered by Impact and Ease of Implementation**:

#### **Most Impactful**:
1. **Increase Non-Spike Data Ratio**: Adjust dataset balance to 1:10.
2. **Add Confidence Threshold**:
   - Filter predictions based on a minimum confidence score (e.g., 0.8).
   - Reduces false positives by requiring stronger predictions.
3. **Add Volume Feature**:
   - Include stock trading volume as an additional feature.
   - Can be calculated and added to existing preprocessing scripts.

#### **Moderately Impactful**:
4. **Add Weighted Loss Function**:
   - Penalize misclassified spikes more heavily during training.
   - Requires minor adjustments to the training script.
5. **Tune Spike Threshold**:
   - Experiment with different thresholds (e.g., 50%, 90%) to optimize the system.
6. **Introduce Moving Averages**:
   - Add short-term and long-term moving averages as features (e.g., 10-day and 50-day averages).

#### **Least Impactful (or More Complex)**:
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters.
   - Increases model performance but requires computational resources.
8. **Feature Importance Visualization**:
   - Use SHAP or similar tools to analyze and visualize the model’s decision-making.

### 4. **Conflict List**
No major conflicts exist, but there are dependencies and considerations:
   - **Weighted Loss Function vs. Increased Non-Spike Data**:
     - Both address class imbalance but using both might overemphasize the non-spike data. Start with one, and add the other if needed.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning and Feature Addition**:
     - Tuning hyperparameters before adding new features wastes effort. Add features first.

### 5. **File-Specific Implementation Plan**

#### **Existing Files**:
1. **`data_preprocess.py`**:
   - Add functionality to increase non-spike data ratio.
   - Introduce volume calculations.

2. **`short_spike_preprocessing.py`**:
   - Implement moving averages.
   - Add spike threshold variations for testing.

3. **`short_spike_training.py`**:
   - Integrate confidence threshold filtering during training.
   - Add weighted loss function.

4. **`short_spike_validation.py`**:
   - Validate confidence threshold impact.
   - Test different spike thresholds and report metrics.

5. **`short_spike_live_test.py`**:
   - Implement confidence-based filtering for live predictions.

#### **New Files**:
1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create `src/features/feature_engineering.py` for calculating and saving derived features (e.g., moving averages, volume).
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Create `src/training/hyperparameter_tuning.py` to experiment with grid search or random search.

### Final Notes
By following the incremental plan and file-specific assignments, you can build and refine BullBot effectively. Start with the dataset ratio adjustment and confidence thresholds to address false positives, then add features like volume and moving averages for deeper insights. Let me know when you're ready to start, and I can provide specific code snippets for each step!
